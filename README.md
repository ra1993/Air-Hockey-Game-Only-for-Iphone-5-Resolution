# Air-Hockey-Game-Only-for-Iphone-5-Resolution


Details:
1. Coded and developed in Lua and CoronaSDK.
2. Must keep lua text file in the folder with pictures.
3. Open main.lua file with Corona SDK.
4. Go to view and for "View as" select Iphone 5.




Bugs to figure out:
1. Fix reset button to delete/destory pucks also keeping strikers from moving when transitioning to starting point. 
2. Fixing the strikers to not count points and from moving off screen when it goes past the goals.
3. Fixing game settings to accomodate all device resolutions not just the Iphone 5 screen resolution.
